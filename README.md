### Hi there, my name is Andres Quintero and I'm a Web Developer based on Venezuela and working full time remote. ðŸ‘‹

I love Javascript and the amazing things you can do with this language thanks to its amazing libraries and amazing community. I am also a lover of implementing the knowledge I have in Javascript for e-commerce platforms, providing the client with a better user experience.

I'm interested in learning about mobile development with technologies like Ionic or React native.

I like being an important part of my work team and I am very excited to experiment with new technologies to constantly grow.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently work with Shopify, creating online stores for clients around the world.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying React.js and Vue.js to deepen my knowledge.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for a work team where I can make a difference and be a useful person to the project.
- ðŸ’¬ What could I talk for 30 minutes about with absolutely no preparation? The advantages of having a good presence on the internet and the benefits of process automation... and Naruto.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to cook but I'm a disaster when I cook, I always have to spend half an hour cleaning up after I'm done.
